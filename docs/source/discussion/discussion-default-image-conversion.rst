=============================
Webp Default Image Conversion
=============================

What is WebP?
-------------

WebP is a modern image format developed by Google that provides superior lossless and lossy compression for images on the web. This means smaller file sizes and faster loading times compared to traditional formats like PNG or JPEG, without sacrificing visual quality.

Why Convert Images?
-------------------

Converting uploaded images to WebP offers several advantages:

**Improved Website Performance:** Smaller image sizes mean faster page loads, leading to a better user experience.

**Bandwidth Savings:** Reduced bandwidth usage benefits both website owners and visitors, especially on mobile devices.

**SEO Benefits:** Faster websites tend to rank higher in search engine results.

How Does Our Code Do It?
------------------------

The `convert_image_to_webp` function handles the conversion process. Let's break it down step by step:

**Function Input:** The function takes an UploadedFile object as input. This object represents an image file uploaded by a user.

**Opening the Image:** The code opens the uploaded image file in binary read mode ("rb").

**Handling Image Types:** The code intelligently checks whether the image is animated (like a GIF) or a single frame (like a JPEG or PNG). It then converts all frames to the RGB color model, if necessary.

**Determining Quality:** The function uses a helper function, `_determine_quality`, to calculate the optimal compression quality for the WebP image based on the original file size. This helps maintain a good balance between image quality and file size reduction.

**Saving as WebP:** The image is saved in the `WebP` format to a BytesIO stream (an in-memory file-like object). The compression quality and method are specified to optimize the conversion.

**Renaming:** The original filename is modified to have the `.webp` extension.

**Return Values:** The function returns a tuple containing the new WebP filename and the BytesIO stream containing the converted image data.

Key Points for New Developers:
------------------------------

**Dependencies:** Ensure you have the Pillow (PIL fork) library installed to work with images.

**Image Quality:** The `_determine_quality` function plays a crucial role in balancing image quality and compression.

**Production-Ready Code:** Remove debugging output and integrate proper image storage mechanisms for real-world applications.
